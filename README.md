# SwiftyDropbox

A Swift SDK for integrating with the Dropbox API v2.

## Setup

To get started with SwiftyDropbox, we recommend you add it to your project using CocoaPods.

1. Install CocoaPods:
    ```
    sudo gem install cocoapods
    ```

1. If you've never used CocoaPods before, run:
    ```
    pod setup
    ```

1. In your project directory, create a new file and call it "Podfile". Add the following text to the file:

    ```ruby
      platform :ios, '8.0'
      use_frameworks!

      target '<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>' do
        pod 'SwiftyDropbox'
      end
    ```

1. From the project directory, install the SwiftyDropbox SDK with:

    ```
    pod install
    ```

## Creating an application

You need to create an Dropbox Application to make API requests.

- Go to https://dropbox.com/developers/apps.

## Obtaining an access token

All requests need to be made with an OAuth 2 access token. To get started, once
you've created an app, you can go to the app's console and generate an access
token for your own Dropbox account.

## Examples

* [PhotoWatch](https://github.com/dropbox/PhotoWatch) - View photos from your Dropbox on your Apple Watch.

## Modifications

If you're interested in modifying the SwiftyDropbox codebase, clone the GitHub repository to your local filesystem
and run `git submodule init` and then `git submodule update`, then navigate to ./TestSwifty and run `pod install`.
Once this is complete, open the ./TestSwifty/TestSwifty.xcworkspace file with Xcode and proceed to implement your
changes to the SwiftyDropbox source code.

To ensure your changes have not broken any existing functionality, you may run a series of comprehensive unit tests by
following the instructions listed in the ./TestSwifty/TestSwifty/ViewController.swift file.
